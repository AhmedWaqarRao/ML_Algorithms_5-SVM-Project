1. Predicting Breast Cancer using SVMPredicting Breast Cancer using SVM

We used sk-learn builtin dataset called load_breast_cancer. 
We try to predict the presence or absence of breast cancer using various medical features such as mean radius, mean concavity, worst fractal dimension, etc. 
We then used the Support Vector Machine Algorithm to develop a model to predict on the test dataset.

2. Predicting Flowers Class using SVMPredicting Flowers Class using SVM

We used a built-in seaborn iris dataset which has 3 classes and
we tried to predict them using various, input features such as sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, and petal_width. 
We then use the SVM algorithm to develop a hyper-plane to distinguish the 3 classes.
