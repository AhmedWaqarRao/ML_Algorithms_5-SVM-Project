Predicting Breast Cancer using SVMPredicting Breast Cancer using SVM

We used sklearn builtin dataset called load_breast_cancer. 
We try to predict the presence or absence of breast cancer using various medical features such as mean radius, mean concavity, worst fractal dimension etc. 
We then used Support Vector Machine Algorithm to develop a model to predict on test dataset.
